Sven could barely hold the light to his cigarette. His hand bounced and danced as it tried to reach the end of the limp cigarette. The lighter behaved as it usually does producing the beautiful yellow-orange flame, but refused to approach the cigarette. He seemed to clench his teeth a bit tighter around the butt of the cigarette and held the lighter just a bit firmer and the yellow flame continued to evade the tobacco.

I could see frustration build, first in his hand, but the growing tension only seemed to make the flame more evasive, as if it had taken hold of his whole body with its strange behavior. His gaze followed his arm, as if to make it cooperate by an act of will but as sure as his attention fell upon it, the flame’s influence fell further upon his body. More and more the rest of him was totally infiltrated with the erratic behavior of the flame. All of him was awash in the power of the flame and his face twisted, tears seeming to form at the corners of his eyes. He looked very fragile, about to break and disappear with the flame.

Hans grasped his trembling hand, thrust it at the very short cigarette in his mouth, long enough for him to suck in a few draughts and then spit it back out. His hand continued to hold the flame, only long enough for him to watch both the cigarette and the flame consumed. As soon as the flame was gone, Hans thrust another cartridge of ammunition against his chest.

“Fucking oil it this time”, he said. The MG42 was a rather fickle device in these temperatures. But once fed it was a proper machine. Reliable and predictable and dependable. The heat of its discharge more than enough to keep the squad going. Sven fingered the box of ammunition a bit before properly stowing it in the fox hole below a thin layer of feldgrau we had salvaged from one of our fallen comrades.

I stood at the back of the foxhole, standing on a cut in the earthen wall, high enough to see over the entrenchment, but low enough to remain camouflaged under the netting. I watched as Sven produced the small amount of gun oil we had requisitioned from the Supply Officer from inside his coat, oiled the ammunition so slightly to preserve our supply of lubricant, before placing it back in its spot. Hans leaned forward against the MG42, smoking a clean fresh cigarette; he would not share his cigarettes with anyone but me, and only on occasion. Sven reached for the magazine of the MG42, attempting to disengage it from the action of the machine gun. Hans’ boot fell on his hand hard and suddenly.

“Don’t fucking take that off you dumb shit. What if the fucking Americans attack and your diddling the ammunition. Keep your ass in the hole and your eyes on the line.” Sven slid back into the bottom of the fox hole and gazed intently. The dark trees, dusted with snow at the top were inviting, and the field looked pleasant with a fresh layer of snow across it. The damage of the previous night’s artillery barrage was hidden by the new snow. It all looked perfectly pleasant and inviting, save for the knowledge of what was on the opposite side of the field. The Americans were encamped in the next field and occupied the tree line. They had broken across the lines at Bastogne, where we had previously encircled them. A crash of Sherman tanks lead by their Patton had broken the siege, and pushed us back into the Ardennes, threatening our offensive and taking the advantage. Every night they mortared our positions, and Hans was convinced that the ‘big one’ was coming soon. The Americans were quiet during the day, probing our lines at night with machine gun fire, certainly so that we might retaliate in force and reveal our entrenchments, our machine guns in particular. Hans, Sven, and I were occupying the forward position, a few meters forward than everyone else and central in the line.

I felt pity for Sven. We were the very same age but far from similar to one another. He was a conscript and I was a volunteer. I wasn’t certain he was even a member of the Nazi party. I joined as soon as I was eligible. Leader of my troop in the Hitler Youth. Willing and energetic contributor to the cause. Sven didn’t really seem to have believed or served in anything. Hans was suspicious of him. I only pitied him. He was harmless, not really incompetent, just a conscript. Underprivileged for having never had the proper training that would otherwise help to dissipate Hans’ hate and derision of him. What more he was likely to die for the fact that he was conscripted. If he did not desert, he was likely to be killed in combat. If he did desert, he would surely be hanged. Desertions were up and the military police were efficient at discovering them. I think suicides were also frequent but counted amongst the casualties.

On our left were Dutch fascists, and on our right were SS troops, redeployed from the Italian front in an attempt to take back the advantage so close to the German border. The SS troops were mostly quiet, keeping to themselves and the commanders were keeping us mostly in the dark. I had heard a few things from the Dutch troops about the Eastern Front. The propaganda said that the Reds were about to be on their heels, pushed too far into our territory and were nearly exhausted. They had said that in 43’ after Kursk. They said that in 42’ after Crimea. They said it months ago about the Americans in Bastogne. They were saying it now.

The SS troops said something different, but all the Regulars were quite despondent. I still believed that we could win. At least here. And if we could win here we might be able to negotiate peace with the West to redouble our efforts in the East. Hans believed as much, and on good days so did I, believing that we were on the verge of winning the war. I believed that in 42’ after the invasion of Russia. We all believed it. But now things were starting to feel different.

“Pick up your field glass Jakob!” Hans commanded. “Get your eyes on the tree line.” I followed the orders mechanically.

“Sven,” Hans began to whisper harshly, as he placed his shoulder against the butt of the MG42, and lifted his hand to the pistol grip, “get into position. Jakob, report movement on the tree line. 20 troops.” I raised the field glasses to my eye; they were dirty and I had to lower them and clean the lenses with my cuff before raising them again. I saw nothing but darkness between the trees and the snowy field before it ended in dirt and pine needles.

“I don’t see anything Feldwebel.” Hans was sighting down the machine gun, the butt firmly against his shoulder.
He got very quiet and closed one eye as he pressed his cheek against the machine gun. “Look a few meters in front of the tree line. 1 o’clock. They have dug camouflaged entrenchments in the night. They’re moving into position.” I focused the glasses at the position he indicated. There was the same grey and white and darkness for the most part. The overcast sky didn’t reveal much. Then a bit of movement caught my eye. A piece of snow moved, raising itself, revealing a pair of dark eyes, then slowly lowering itself again.

“I see them.” I raised the receiver of the radio and reported the information. Hans peeled the receiver back, slowly till a round was delivered into the chamber, then slowly letting it fall back into its original position. It was quiet and the sound would carry otherwise.
“Advise the flanks to look for something similar. The Americans might be moving in force in camouflaged entrenchments.” I gave Sven their position, and he radioed back to the Command Post. I swept the tree line with the field glasses and didn’t see any more movement. Then cast the glasses across our own line. The SS foxholes were well camouflaged, but I could pick out their own machine gun positions. Their machine gunners were similarly braced as Hans.

I felt Hans slam a hand into the back of my helmet. “Keep your eyes on their line, not ours.” I returned my field glasses to the far side of the field, but there was no more movement. My hands were getting very cold, and I couldn’t keep the glasses steady. They bounced around and it created the simulation of movement. I couldn’t be certain if anything was moving on the far side of the field. This went on for an hour. There was no reprieve. I was shivering. I wasn’t sure how Hans remained in the same position for so long. The gun metal had to be cold against his shoulder and cheek. He breathed steadily, but I felt my heart racing the whole time.
